## Requirements and understanding
This was built only for desktop view and no intention of mobile view per specification. The smallest width taken into consideration was 1024 x 600,
for the complete list of screen sizes tested for, [visit this link](http://whatismyscreenresolution.net/multi-screen-test) and click the desktop icon at the top left.
There are some mobile queries coded for, but just enough to make the mobile view not incredibly painful to look at. Everything was done with my knowledge and had no outside help.

The info sections will have the left side go on top of the right side if they get too close, it may be hard to tell because of the white text color.
